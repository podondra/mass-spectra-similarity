# Mass Spectra Similarity (Bioinformatics)

MI-VMM project at FIT Czech Technical University.

## Assigment

Project's goal is to implement application which searches peptide sequence
in protein sequence database according to similarity to input mass spectrum.

### Input

Mass spectrum and protein sequence database.

### Output

Set of peptide sequences similar to input mass spectra sorted according to
similarity.
